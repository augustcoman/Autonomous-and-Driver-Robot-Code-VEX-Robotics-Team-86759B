# Autonomous-and-Driver-Robot-Code-VEX-Robotics-Team-86759B
Name: Autonomous and Driver Robot Code for VEX Robotics Team 86759B

Language: c++

Description:
These files are the source code for the program that ran our robot in the 2020-2021 VEX Robotics competitions. I was the one who wrote the entire code for the Robot. Our team (86759B) qualified for state and worlds. In the worlds competition, we made it into the quarterfinals in the eliminations. Our team also got a highest combined skills score of 207, with 93 points in the autonomous skills and 114 points in the driver skills.

The main.cpp file contains the main code thread for the driver controlled period and the autonomous period. Included is a user interface in the pre_auton thread, which allows us to configure the autonomous behavior before the match. The autonmethods.cpp file contains autonomous methods used in the main file. These methods turn simple commands, such as drive forward or rotate, into the complex set of maneuvers needed to drive our robot accurately. The robot-config.cpp configures the motors of the robot.

User information: This program can only be ran on a robot with VEX V5 hardware. This program will only run properly on a robot with the same mechanical devices as the original robot it was designed for.
